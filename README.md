# New Religious Movement Database

I started this project with the intention of creating a database of new religious movements and cults that people could search through and learn more, because that does not currently exist. I also wanted to include a map that would give the location of the headquarters of each for those who were curious.

I couldn't find the location data, so I decided to stick with my original idea. However, when I scraped the data it kept giving me the results back separated by each individual letter, and not returning whole words. I couldn't use this for my flask app. Because I waited too long to start this project, I am simply turning in what I have and accepting the grade I get, even though it is no where near finished. I hope to continue working on this after graduation, even though I am having trouble finding a solution to the word separation problem.
